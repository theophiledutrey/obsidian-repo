### 🔹 Find SUID/SGID files

```bash
find / -perm -4000 2>/dev/null
```

> Lists all files with SUID/SGID permissions. These can often be exploited to run programs with elevated privileges. (chmod 4000 for owner and chmod 2000 for group)

### 🔹 Check sudo rights

```bash
sudo -l
```

> Displays commands the current user can execute via sudo, with or without a password.

### 🔹 Check Linux capabilities

```bash
getcap -r / 2>/dev/null | grep '/bin/'
```

> Recursively lists files with Linux capabilities (e.g. `cap_setuid`, `cap_net_bind_service`), filtered for `/bin`.

### 🔹 Find files belonging to your group

```bash
id         # check your groups
find / -group yourgroup -type f 2>/dev/null
```

> Search for files owned by a group you are a member of.

### 🔹 Useful directories to investigate

- `/tmp`, `/var/tmp`, `/var/backups`
- `/var/mail`, `/var/spool/mail`
- `/etc/exports`
- `/opt/`: often used for custom applications

### 🔹 List open ports

```bash
netstat -tulnp
```

### 🔹 Port forwarding

```bash
ssh -L 8000:127.0.0.1:8000 enzo@10.10.11.68
```
