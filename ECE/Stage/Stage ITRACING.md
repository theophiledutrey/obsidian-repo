Hi, my name is Théophile, and I’m currently in my final year of engineering school at ECE Paris, where I specialize in cybersecurity.

I’m currently passionate about IT and network security. During my first year of engineering, I had the chance to study abroad at the Warsaw University of Technology in Poland. There, I focused on cryptography, C/C++ development, and security of information system.

Now, in my second year of the engineering cycle, I’m studying cybersecurity in depth — things like Linux and Windows security, Active Directory, forensics, and container security. I’m also learning about networks, DevOps, and databases.

This summer, I did an internship at a cybersecurity startup called P4S. They created a hardware device that protects networks like a firewall and cipher, but without changing the existing setup. My job was to perform penetration testing on their device, then develop a script to automate these tests and generate a full security report.

Before that, I also worked at a small company called CoreTechnologie. There, I helped refactor their C++ code and later returned for a short project where I connected a 3D printer to their system using a Raspberry Pi and a custom API.

In 2024, I also did an internship at Delaware Consulting, where I worked on integrating an AI assistant into their SAP development environment. That gave me a taste of consulting and teamwork in a larger company.

Outside of school, I practice cybersecurity with CTFs and platforms like Hack The Box and TryHackMe, and I’m part of the cybersecurity club at my school.

To sum up, I’m a curious and motivated person who loves technical challenges, but also likes working with people. I’d really like to bring both my technical skills and my enthusiasm to a company like yours.
